## ✅ What is Java?

Java is a **high-level, object-oriented programming language** developed by **Sun Microsystems** in the early 1990s.
It is known for its **simplicity, portability, security**, and **robustness**.

Java is used to build:
- Desktop applications 🖥️
- Web applications 🌐
- Mobile apps 📱
- Enterprise systems 💼
- Embedded systems 🤖

Java follows the **WORA** principle — *Write Once, Run Anywhere* — meaning the same Java code can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## 📜 History of Java

In the early 1990s, a group of engineers at Sun Microsystems, led by **James Gosling**, started a project called the **Green Project**. Their mission was to create a **platform-independent language** for digital devices like cable boxes.

They first named the language **Oak**, after the tree outside Gosling’s window. But due to a trademark issue, it was later renamed to **Java**, inspired by the coffee they loved ☕.

Java was officially released in **1995**, introducing a new way of building secure, robust, cross-platform applications.

Sun Microsystems was acquired by **Oracle Corporation** in 2010, and Oracle has maintained Java since then.

## 💡 Features of Java

| Feature             | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Simple**          | Easy to learn, similar syntax to C++ but without complexity                 |
| **Object-Oriented** | Everything is treated as objects and classes                                |
| **Platform Independent** | Java code runs on any system with a JVM                            |
| **Secure**          | Bytecode verification and no direct memory access                           |
| **Robust**          | Strong memory management and exception handling                             |
| **Multithreaded**   | Supports concurrent execution of threads                                    |
| **Portable**        | Bytecode can be run on any device with a JVM                                |
| **High Performance**| Uses JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler for fast execution                         |
| **Distributed**     | Supports remote method invocation (RMI), enterprise systems                 |
| **Dynamic**         | Loads classes dynamically during execution                                  |

## 🌍 Why Java is Platform Independent?

Java source code is compiled into **bytecode**, which is **not platform-specific**.
This bytecode is executed by the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, which exists for many platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.).

> 🧠 So, the same `.class` file can run anywhere, as long as a JVM is installed.

This gives rise to the phrase:
**"Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)"**

## 🧱 Java Editions

Java comes in different editions tailored for specific use cases:

| Edition       | Purpose                                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Java SE**   | Standard Edition — Core libraries, OOP, collections, etc. |
| **Java EE**   | Enterprise Edition — Web apps, servlets, JSP, EJB        |
| **Java ME**   | Micro Edition — Embedded devices, mobile platforms       |
| **Java FX**   | Modern UI for desktop applications                       |
